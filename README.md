# Summary
In this test we are going to code a small Web Application to help the managers better understand the results of their teammate's happiness survey results, as well as create actions to follow up on these surveys in a simple kanban view
During this session of ~4-8h, we will evaluate your coding skills on multiple aspects!! It is important to read all the instructions before to start your chrono ‚è±!.

## Instructions
We are trying to build analyze our teammates mindstate app, which will be done in two phases
* Create a small dashboard containing general information you can gather from the joined csv dataset. This data contains results to a survey your teammates took, where they give insights about their personal aspirations in their job. For example:
  * Number of users answering the survey
  * Information about these users 
  * Repartition of "modes"
  * Anything else you might feel is relevant
* Create a small app to create and track actions to help your teammates change their job toward something that suits them better :
  * Fetch the existing user actions
  * Display the user actions
  * Create an action
  * Change the card status from Pending or Rejected to Done and from Done to Rejected.
  * Add a local filtering by user name or action title


## Requirements
The data dashboard can be part of the actions app or be implemented separately using any tech stack you so desire 

The actions app must use the following tech stack:
* Angular
* NestJS
* Postgres

  
The whole application must run under docker, and be startable using docker-compose or using a simple makefile oneliner

## Bonus points
* Code structure, data modeling and best practices
* UI/UX design
* Writing tests

## Timing
Don't forget to share with us the time you have spent on this project!
